# Python 101 for the VMware Admin

Module driven approach to learning the basics of Python for REST API's. Begins with basic usage of Python outside of vCenter and graduates into consuming the vCenter REST APIs both using the `requests` module as well as the REST SDK for Python.

## Module List and Description

**Module 1 - Variables** - Approach creating basic variables in Python and printing those variables out.

**Module 2 - Modules** - Modules extend Python's ability to interact by bringing in custom functionality based on the module that is being used. Modules exist for thousands of different use cases. We focus on basic usage of the `os` module and `requests` module.

**Module 3 - Requests Module** - A deeper look at the `requests` module working against the Star Wars API

**Module 4 - Loops** - Work with multi-object returns, looping over the results and parsing the return

**Module 5 - Functions** - Create functions to modularize your code

**Module 6 - vCenter Connectivity** - Connect to vCenter and perform basic REST calls

**Module 7 - vCenter Python REST SDK** - Leverage the Python REST SDK to simplify your interactions
